## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository where Iâ€™m focusing on SQL performance tuning and indexing strategies for relational databases. This space is dedicated to learning how to write faster, more efficient queries and how to structure data access in a way that scales with growing workloads and complexity.

As a backend engineer, I understand how critical database performance is to the overall health and responsiveness of applications. Poorly optimized queries and unindexed columns can quickly become bottlenecks, especially as data volume grows. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m diving deeper into the internals of SQL execution plans, index design, and optimization techniques.

In this repository, you'll find a series of practical experiments and small projects aimed at improving query performance using real-world patterns. These include examples of slow queries and the step-by-step process of analyzing and optimizing them using EXPLAIN plans, proper indexing, denormalization techniques, and query refactoring. Iâ€™m working with databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL, and documenting each learning opportunity as clearly as possible.

My goal is to not only improve performance but also gain a deeper understanding of how relational databases work under the hoodâ€”how indexes are used, when they arenâ€™t, and how query planners make decisions. Each project is supported by notes and insights drawn from hands-on testing, highlighting both successful optimizations and things that didnâ€™t work as expected.

This repository is a work in progress, reflecting my ongoing journey in mastering SQL performance. If you're also exploring query optimization, database indexing, or backend performance in general, I hope this collection provides value and practical takeaways.

Contributions, feedback, and tips from more experienced database engineers are always welcome as I continue to sharpen my backend performance skills.
